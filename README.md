# Stack Overflow Programming Language Visualization

This is a data visualization program that takes information (tag names and number of times each tag is used) from Stack Overflow's data dump, cross references it with a list of programming languages from Wikipedia, finds the results that are on both lists. The common items are then sorted to find the tags which are most frequently used on Stack Overflow, and the top 10 results are displayed in a pie chart. This is valuable information because it shows which programming languages are most frequently tagged on Stack Overflow posts, which can help us understand which languages are most common.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Below is the list of software I used during the development process. I will include installation instructions in the future, if requested.

```
cycler==0.10.0
kiwisolver==1.0.1
matplotlib==3.0.0
numpy==1.15.2
pyparsing==2.2.2
python-dateutil==2.7.3
six==1.11.0
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running will be included, if requested.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
